Typr is a lightweight desktop dictation app for Windows. Press a global hotkey, speak, and the recognized text is pasted into whatever window is active.

## Features

- **Setup wizard** on the first launch: the interface language, how to recognize speech (with a recommendation for this computer), the model or key, the hotkey.
- **Global hotkey** in two modes: a key combination or a single mouse button (middle or side).
- **Local recognition** with [transcribe.cpp](https://github.com/handy-computer/transcribe.cpp): Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3, Whisper Large v3, Large v3 Turbo and Medium run on your computer, the audio never leaves it. They run on the GPU through Vulkan (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel) or on the CPU. Models are downloaded and deleted in the settings, and an idle model leaves memory by itself.
- **Cloud speech-to-text providers:** Groq (Whisper Large v3/v3 Turbo), [Polza.AI](https://polza.ai/), [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) (Universal-3.5 Pro/Universal-2), and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Recordings are sent as FLAC where the service takes it, over a connection opened while you speak.
- **Local fallback:** if the cloud fails, a downloaded local model transcribes the dictation; the next one goes to the cloud again.
- **Language of the speech:** detected automatically or fixed (Russian, English and more), which helps short phrases.
- **Post-processing:** an AI model (Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq or Polza) polishes the text before it is pasted, in the Chill, Proper or your own style.
- **Clean clipboard:** the dictated text is pasted through the clipboard and stays out of the Windows clipboard history.
- **Space after the text**, so the next phrase doesn't stick to the previous one.
- **Tray menu:** paste the last dictation again, switch the engine, open the settings, turn the hotkey off.
- **Starts with Windows** (optional) and **checks GitHub for new releases.**
- **Recording indicator:** a small mic slides down from behind the top edge of the screen only while you dictate (recording, transcribing, pasting) and hides again.
- **Tiny footprint:** about 5 MB of RAM in the tray! The settings window's WebView is released when it's closed, and the recording indicator is drawn natively.
- **Developer mode:** a live log of everything the app does, for troubleshooting.
- **English and Russian interface.**
- Dark, minimal interface in the Anthropic style.

## Building

The installer is built by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) when a `v*` tag is pushed or the workflow is started manually:

```bash
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin v2.0.0
```

Local development needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Built with [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/) (Rust) and vanilla TypeScript.
